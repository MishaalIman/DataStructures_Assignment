# DataStructures_Assignment

Announcement: Maintaining a GitHub Repository

Objective: To develop organizational and coding skills by maintaining a GitHub repository containing program files for all the topics covered in this course.

Instructions:
Create a GitHub Repository:

Name your repository appropriately, e.g., DataStructures_Assignment or CourseWork_Repo.

Make the repository public and ensure it is well-maintained throughout the course.

Structure of the Repository: Your repository should include folders for each topic we have covered in the course. Inside each folder, create and maintain program files for the respective subtopics. The structure should look like this:

Arrays

Separate program files for all array-related problems

Linked Lists

Singular Linked List

Singular Linked List (Modified with Tail)

Double Linked List

Stacks

Implementation using Linked List

Implementation using Arrays

Programs for Stack Problems (all in separate files)

Queues

Implementation using Linked List

Implementation using Arrays

Programs for Queue Problems (all in separate files)

Topics to be Covered in Future

Implementations

Practice Problem files


Content Requirements:

Stick to one programming language throughout the repository (e.g., Python, Java, or C++).

Each program file should be properly named, e.g., stack_array_implementation.cpp or queue_linkedlist_problem1.py.

Include comments in your code (for yourself to remember).

Ensure all files are functional and tested.

Your commit history will also be reviewed to assess how consistently you have been practicing. Frequent and meaningful updates will reflect positively on your grade.

Grading Criteria:
Organization (25%): Proper folder structure and clear naming conventions.

Completeness (50%): All topics and subtopics covered with required program files.

Code Quality (25%): Functional programs with your remembering comments and readability.

Deadline:
Your repository will be reviewed and graded at the end of the course. Ensure it is complete and up-to-date by the final submission date.

Note: This assignment is a valuable opportunity to learn and practice real-world skills. If you face any challenges, feel free to reach out for help during class or office hours.

Good luck, and happy coding!
