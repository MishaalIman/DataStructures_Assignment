Working on this assignment deepened my understanding of core data structures and their real-world applications. I improved my problem-solving skills, learned to write cleaner and more efficient code, and strengthened my ability to analyze time and space complexity. Implementing these structures from scratch gave me a stronger foundation for more advanced algorithms and competitive programming.
